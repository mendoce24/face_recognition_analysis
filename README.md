# face_recognition_analysis

A solo personal project as part of the **AI Bootcamp**

## Project description

This is a project of face recognition and analysis with `DeepFace` from different images. This project leverages the power of DeepFace, a powerful Python library for face recognition, analysis, and facial attribute detection. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or enthusiast, this project is designed to help you harness the capabilities of DeepFace and integrate it into your applications, research, or experiments.

DeepFace is a versatile tool that allows you to:

Detect faces in images and videos.
Analyze facial attributes such as emotions, age, gender, and race.
Perform face recognition and compare faces against a database.
Evaluate the similarity between faces using various distance metrics.
And much more!

2. Change directory to the root of the repository
3. Install required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
- The DeepFace Project is designed for a wide range of applications, including:

    Security and access control systems.
    Emotion analysis in video content.
    Facial attribute recognition for marketing and audience analysis.
    Research in computer vision and machine learning.
    And any project where understanding and working with faces is essential.
- Execute the script by running the Jupyter notebook `computer_vision.ipynb`.
